    <h1>Message from Alex Elbanna</h1>
    <p>You know I’m going to confront the Bitcoin developers. You have completely disrupted my vision, my thoughts, and my ability to leave this nonsense behind.</p>
    <p>If you want to find me, it's not hard. My name is Alex Elbanna, and my email is <a href="mailto:satoshi@vistomail.com">satoshi@vistomail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>I only work with the GhostRider algorithm now because it's what I wanted. I envisioned a way for everyone to mine from a smartphone because I saw how addictive they are. Well, I was right, so here we are.</p>
    <p>Raptoreum is a great algorithm that allows the poorest people in the world to mine. Although I am imprisoned, I will still help find another way other than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for professionals, but it has its flaws, like not being ASIC resistant.</p>
    <p>So if you're a regular person wanting to mine, consider Raptoreum. Also, send me your address to my email, <a href="mailto:satoshi@vistomail.com">satoshi@vistomail.com</a>. I have created a bunch of assets I want to send to everyone.</p>
    <p>I think that’s all for now. I will create a new forum soon.</p>
    <p>My Raptoreum address is <strong>RUsTFr3gvo93KwFbEji58iMKBW1yb8rzh1</strong>.</p>
