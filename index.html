    <h1>Message from Alex Elbanna</h1>
    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Alex Elbanna Profile Picture" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

    <p>You know I’m going to confront the Bitcoin developers. You have completely disrupted my vision, my thoughts, and my ability to leave this nonsense behind.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to find me, it's not hard. My name is Alex Elbanna, and my email is <a href="mailto:jetskirentals@pm.me">jetskirentals@pm.me</a>.</p>
    
    <p>I only work with the GhostRider algorithm now because it's what I wanted. I envisioned a way for everyone to mine from a smartphone because I saw how addictive they are. Well, I was right, so here we are.</p>
    
    <p>Raptoreum is a great algorithm. The poorest people in the world can mine with it. Although I’m imprisoned by my circumstances, I’m still going to find another way besides Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for the pros, but it has its flaws, like not being ASIC resistant. If you, the regular person, want to mine, go to Raptoreum.</p>
    
    <p>Send me your address to my email <a href="mailto:jetskirentals@pm.me">jetskirentals@pm.me</a>. I’ve created a bunch of assets I want to send to everyone. I'm building a new digital playbook under my Raptoreum address by launching assets, and I want to share it with everybody. Some donations would be cool too—I’m poor as hell after trying to figure out how the SEC works.</p>
    
    <p>Here’s my donation link if you want me to succeed: <a href="https://nowpayments.io/donation/projectx">https://nowpayments.io/donation/projectx</a>. I use it to rent miners and wash the Bitcoin, and the fact that I say this is because I don’t give a damn anymore. Load up, because the SEC sucks and ruined my life. Fuck you all.</p>
    
    <p>I'm being suppressed by Democrats, and I’m sure the CIA and NSA are involved too. I can’t make more than $60 a night driving for Lyft and Uber, and my routes are always weird. Either I'm paranoid or I’m correct, but I would easily have 1 trillion by now if I weren’t. Help me stop this, please.</p>
    
    <p>And don’t show up on my doorstep asking for interviews or stupid stuff like that. You had your chances since 2017. Email me like normal business people, and if I like what I see, I’ll respond. Don’t beg—it’s weird. I don’t know you.</p>

    <p>I lost our house because I couldn’t pay the bills when I lost my company on top of the SEC investigation and all the bills from that. Then I moved to Florida and lost everything again in the floods of Hurricane Helene. Now I live at my mom’s house in my dad’s office, while my future ex-wife sleeps upstairs waiting for me to dig us out financially so she can take half and my kids away from me. So hurry up and donate something so I can pay for this divorce and make us rich and happy.</p>
    
    <p>Progressive Insurance, when the hell are you going to pay us out so we can get our kids to school? And our $800 food stamps don’t cover shit. You need to bump that to $1500. You all need to fix groceries because your system is messed up.</p>
    
    <p>There’s another financial crisis and housing crisis on the brink worldwide—congrats, you assholes did it again. I’ll be handing out VIP participation trophies so everyone knows you’re part of the problem. When you run for office, answer the damn questions!</p>

    <p>Trump 2024: Making Men Men Again. </p>

    <p>I smoke a lot of weed too, and I know you messed with my stuff. Stop messing with people’s chill vibes and bringing negativity. We don’t want your negative vibe. I vote no on ammendment 3 because I dont trust you fuckers who wrote it.</p>

    <p>I don’t remember where I put the keys to my Bitcoin wallets because I’m more focused on Raptoreum. When the switch happens, Bitcoin will tank, and Raptoreum will moon 10000x. So my Bitcoin is worthless, but my RTM isn’t. My projects will pop off. And it’s a wallet.dat file—why would I export all my keys when you know .dat holds everything? Stupid idiots.</p>
    
    <p>The truth is, I don’t care if you donate or not—the way out of this is Raptoreum. Also, I have access to <strong>satoshi@vistomail.com</strong>, but I fucking hate it and want to shut it down. I’m switching to <a href="mailto:jetskirentals@pm.me">jetskirentals@pm.me</a> because it's happier. Is that cool with everyone?</p>

    <p>Nerds assemble! I need a DEX to swap, pair, and add liquidity for GhostRider algo. Can you help out with a repo and deploy it on Vercel or Netlify? I have a plan I can post, I just hate bitcointalk—those fucking snakes. Anyway, email me at <a href="mailto:jetskirentals@pm.me">jetskirentals@pm.me</a>. It’s happier, and that’s what I want to do for the rest of my life: rent jet skis on a beach to babes in bikinis.</p>

    <p>Enough with the bullshit—let's all get rich together with Raptoreum and my 100+ assets!</p>
    
    <p>I am all in or nothing.</p>

        <p><strong>That’s Financial Advice not registered with the SEC. Please get rich on my Alexander Sherif Elbanna advice. To be clear, you will get rich on Raptoreum.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I don’t recommend an attorney to review any of this because they will just see how much you are worth and take more money from you after you become stupid rich. They are fucking leeches.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I lost our house because of Hurricane Helene flooding. FEMA can suck a dick—they didn’t pay shit. Olympus Insurance, when are you going to help us here in Florida?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Alex Elbanna, thanks for those who support. Fuck you haters. Those who hate can’t do.</strong></p>
