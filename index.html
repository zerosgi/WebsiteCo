    <h1>Message from Alex Elbanna</h1>

    <p>You know I’m going to confront the Bitcoin developers. You have completely disrupted my vision, my thoughts, and my ability to leave this nonsense behind.</p>
    <p>If you want to find me, it's not hard. My name is Alex Elbanna, and my email is <a href="mailto:satoshi@vistomail.com">satoshi@vistomail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>I only work with the GhostRider algorithm now because it's what I wanted. I envisioned a way for everyone to mine from a smartphone because I saw how addictive they are. Well, I was right, so here we are.</p>
    <p>Raptoreum is a great algorithm that allows the poorest people in the world to mine. Although I am imprisoned, I will still help find another way other than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for professionals, but it has its flaws, like not being ASIC resistant.</p>
    <p>So if you're a regular person wanting to mine, consider Raptoreum. Also, send me your address to my email, <a href="mailto:satoshi@vistomail.com">satoshi@vistomail.com</a>. I have created a bunch of assets I want to send to everyone.</p>
    <p>I build a lot of things, and I have many ideas; some are great, and some suck. I'm building a new digital playbook under my Raptoreum address by launching assets, and I want to share it with everybody. Some donations would be appreciated too, as I’m financially struggling after trying to navigate how the SEC works. They robbed me blind, along with attorneys, MTL licenses, exchange source code, dev issues, and all the bills. I'm facing all of this now with Raptoreum.</p>
    <p>Here's my donation link if you care and want me to succeed: <a href="https://nowpayments.io/donation/projectx">https://nowpayments.io/donation/projectx</a>. I use NowPayments to mix the money so the SEC can't trace it. I use it to rent miners and wash the Bitcoin. The fact that I say this is because I don’t care anymore. I hope you all load up and stack, because the SEC sucks and has ruined my life. Fuck you all.</p>
    <p>And I’m being suppressed by Democrats, I’m sure by the CIA, and definitely by the NSA. I can’t make more than $60 a night on Lyft and Uber, and my routes are always weird. I’m stuck — either I’m paranoid, or I’m correct. I would easily have $1 trillion by now if I weren’t being messed with, and I could fix the entire world. So I’m 100% sure I’m being interfered with. I would like not to be. Help me not to be, please.</p>
    <p>My Raptoreum address is <strong>RUsTFr3gvo93KwFbEji58iMKBW1yb8rzh1</strong>.</p>
