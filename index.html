    <h1>Message from Alex Elbanna</h1>
    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Alex Elbanna Profile Picture" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
    <p>You know I’m going to confront the Bitcoin developers. You have completely disrupted my vision, my thoughts, and my ability to leave this nonsense behind.</p>
    <p>If you want to find me, it's not hard. My name is Alex Elbanna, and my email is <a href="mailto:satoshi@vistomail.com">satoshi@vistomail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>I only work with the GhostRider algorithm now because it's what I wanted. I envisioned a way for everyone to mine from a smartphone because I saw how addictive they are. Well, I was right, so here we are.</p>
    <p>Raptoreum is a great algorithm that allows the poorest people in the world to mine. Although I am imprisoned, I will still help find another way other than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for professionals, but it has its flaws, like not being ASIC resistant.</p>
    <p>So if you're a regular person wanting to mine, consider Raptoreum. Also, send me your address to my email, <a href="mailto:satoshi@vistomail.com">satoshi@vistomail.com</a>. I have created a bunch of assets I want to send to everyone.</p>
    <p>I build a lot of things, and I have many ideas; some are great, and some suck. I'm building a new digital playbook under my Raptoreum address by launching assets, and I want to share it with everybody. Some donations would be appreciated too, as I’m financially struggling after trying to navigate how the SEC works. They robbed me blind, along with attorneys, MTL licenses, exchange source code, dev issues, and all the bills. I'm facing all of this now with Raptoreum.</p>
    <p>Here's my donation link if you care and want me to succeed: <a href="https://nowpayments.io/donation/projectx">https://nowpayments.io/donation/projectx</a>. I use NowPayments to mix the money so the SEC can't trace it. I use it to rent miners and wash the Bitcoin. The fact that I say this is because I don’t care anymore. I hope you all load up and stack, because the SEC sucks and has ruined my life. Fuck you all.</p>
    <p>And I’m being suppressed by Democrats, I’m sure by the CIA, and definitely by the NSA. I can’t make more than $60 a night on Lyft and Uber, and my routes are always weird. I’m stuck — either I’m paranoid, or I’m correct. I would easily have $1 trillion by now if I weren’t being messed with, and I could fix the entire world. So I’m 100% sure I’m being interfered with. I would like not to be. Help me not to be, please.</p>
    <p>If this doesn't work, the Hailey Welch and I will collaborate. We gotta give ’em that ‘hawk tuah’ and spit on this thang. You in?</p>
    <p>TRUMP 2024 to confront that ugly witch with her weird first husband—what the hell is that, anyway? Against abortion, for freedom, legalize weed, chill out on guns, screw the border—let them in and put them to work. Screw the broke-ass Federal Reserve, stop the wars, rebuild Gaza, bomb Israel, and end the humanitarian suffering. Transgender issues should stay out of this. Raise the flags, put wind in the sails, and get this country moving. What the hell, guys!</p>
    <p>And I don’t remember where I put the keys to my Bitcoin wallets because I'm more focused on Raptoreum. When the switch happens, Bitcoin will tank, and Raptoreum will fucking moon 10,000X because everyone will be switching to RTM, so my Bitcoin is worthless but my RTM isn't, and all my projects will pop off!! So yeah, I didn’t give a fuck about my keys unless they were Raptoreum keys. And it's a wallet.dat file—why would I export all my keys when you know .dat holds everything? Stupid idiots.</p>
    <p>And don't show up on my fucking doorstep asking for interviews and stupid shit like that. You had your chances since 2017. Email me like normal business people, and if I like what I see, I'll email you back. Don't beg either; it's weird. I don't know you.</p>
    <p>I don't recommend an attorney to review any of this because they will just see how much you are worth and take more money from you after you become stupid rich. They are fucking leeches.</p>
    <p>I'm going through a divorce with three kids, one of whom I haven't seen in a year. What the hell, women? Why do you make men work so fucking hard to take care of you, the kids, and then please you? What about pleasing us? At least Haley knows what's up—get that chick a fucking Range Rover and a Bugatti! WTF????</p>
    <p>I smoke a lot of weed too, and I know you messed with my shit. I don't like it—stop messing with people's chill vibes and bringing that negativity; we don't want your negative vibe.</p>
    <p>And I don’t have a car or house anymore because of Hurricane Helene. We lost everything in the flooding. FEMA can suck a dick; they didn’t pay shit. Olympus Insurance, when are you going to help us here in Florida?</p>
    <p>I am all in or nothing.</p>
    <p>My Raptoreum address is <strong>RUsTFr3gvo93KwFbEji58iMKBW1yb8rzh1</strong>.</p>

        <p>That's financial advice not registered with the SEC. Please get rich on my Alexander Sherif Elbanna advice. To be clear, you will get rich on Raptoreum.</p>
